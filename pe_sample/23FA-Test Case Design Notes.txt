SWT301 - INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE TESTING -> "FINDING BUG!!!"

THERE SHOULD HAVE A METHOD TO FIND A BUG, NOT JUST OPEN THE APP, CLICK XIAOMILY HOPEING THE APP CLAIMS AN ERROR!!!!

SOFTWARE TESTING IS PUTTING APPS (INCLUDING CODE) INTO STRICT STAGES AND TEST ROUNDS IN THE HOPE OF IT PASSING THE TEST, OR IF IT DOESN'T, THEN WE FIND ERRORS
TO EXAMINATE THE SOFTWARE, TESTING THE SOFTWARE, WE SET UP CRITERIA, REGULATIONS, NORMS THAT THE APP MUST MEET AND EXCEED!!!

CRITERIA AND REGULATIONS OF TESTING ARE EXPRESSED THROUGH TEST CASE
>>>>> WHAT IS TEST CASE??? (TEST CASE)
             THIS IS HOW WE SIMULATE THE USER'S USE OF THE APP
             IS HOW WE SIMULATE THE USE OF THE CODER/DEVELOPER FUNCTION

IMAGINE IS TO USE (JUNCT, APP) IN A ROLE-PLAY TYPE
- QC/TESTER PRETEND TO BE USER USING THE APP IN SOME WAY, TO KNOW IF THE APP IS RUNNING CORRECTLY, OR IF THE APP IS RUNNING WRONG
- DEVELOPER PRETENDS TO BE ANOTHER DEV, USES HIMSELF WRITING IT, DOES IT LOOK OK?

APP/FUNCTION TESTING IS USING THE APP/FUNCTION IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE GENERAL, TO SEE IT'S CORRECT AND WRONG, AND FIX IT BEFORE BRINGING IT TO THE MARKET

YOU MUST HAVE A METHOD TO DARE CONCLUSION WHICH IS RIGHT AND WRONG
TEST CASE DESIGN IS THE METHODOLOGY

***** TEST CASE IS A SET OF DATA (INPUT, EXPECTED VALUE) USED TO TEST 1 FUNCTION, 1 FUNCTION (APP)
                                    AND THE STEPS IN USING THAT DATA SET ON THE FUNCTION AND NEEDED FUNCTIONS
- FOR EXAMPLE:
   >>>>> TEST FUNCTION getFactorial(int n) -> long
                                                             n = 5 -> expect the function to return 120
   >>>>> TEST LOGIN username/password FUNCTION
                                       user/pass is WRONG 5 TIMES -> APP/LOGIN FUNCTION IS BLOCKED FOR X DAYS,
                                                                               SO GOOD!!!
                                        User/pass is correct -> GO TO APP WITH CORRECT ROLE
====================================
PE SCHOOL F TEST REQUIREMENTS: DESIGN TEST CASE TO

1. CODE TESTING
- READ A PARAGRAPH OF CODE, FIND ERRORS IN THE CODE

- ASSUME THE CODE HAS BEEN CORRECTED AND WRITTEN CORRECTLY, DESIGN TEST CASE TO PROVE/TEST THAT THE FUNCTION IS GOOD OR NOT

2. FUNCTIONAL TESTING (SCREEN)
- TEST CASE DESIGN
